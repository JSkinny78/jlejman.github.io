## jlejman - What I'm up to
I want to be a programmer. Definitely have gotten that far. Video Game programming would be fun, 
but it's a competitive industry and doesn't give nearly as good pay or job security as software development jobs. 
I work on game development stuff in my free time, and will probably keep that up after college. 
Otherwise I'll probably try for a career doing something in security. Anyway, will add more when there's more to add.
