    <h1>What I'm up to Now</h1>
    <p>
    I want to be a programmer. Definitely have gotten that far. Video Game programming would be fun, 
    but it's a competitive industry and doesn't give nearly as good pay or job security as software development jobs. 
    I work on game development stuff in my free time, and will probably keep that up after college. 
    Otherwise I'll probably try for a career doing something in security. Anyway, will add more when there's more to add.
